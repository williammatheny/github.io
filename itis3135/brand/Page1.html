	<li>
	Ava - Was a cat found on the side of the road and brought to the clinic which was eventually named after her.  Upon visiting the clinic she started to feel way better thanks
   to the wonderful team. She stuck around and has been apart of the clinic ever since.  Ava spends her time with the patients and helping them when she isn't taking her day naps. 
	</li>
	<h3>
	Owner / Veternarian
	</h3>
	<li>
	Dr Jennifer Morley - Has been in love with pets as long as she can remember.  Becoming a veternarian was the only career-path she ever wanted.  She never leaves an animal sick or in need
	without helping them.  She always goes out of her way to help them and make sure they can love their best lives.  Dr Jennier Morley lives on a 20-acre farm where they have several pets including four dogs, two cats,
	fish, a miniature pony, two quarter horses, and a gentle appaloosa.
