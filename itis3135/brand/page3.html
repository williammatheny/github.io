	Note from the author - I want to start this off by saying as the nephew of Dr Jennifer Morley her love for animals is one I haven't seen in anyone else.  She is constantly doing what is best for her pets and others.
	I have heard several stories and phone calls of her pulling over on the side of the road if she sees an injured animal.  She'll then take it in and heal it back to full health before releasing it back.
	It is truly amazing what she does and is extremely incredible the passion she has for all animals of all types.
