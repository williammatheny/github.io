	At Avalon Veterinary Clinic the passion we have for animals is the same as the love we have for people.
	Upon entering you are not the only client as your pet is one as well. If you recently welcomed a four legged friend into
	your life and family we understand you only want the best for them, and we will treat you with that respect that you both deserve.
	The next time you are in the neighborhood of Tulsa Oklahoma come say hi, you and your four legged friend are both welcome!
